      <h2>Our Goal</h2>
      <p>Paws 4 You was made to bring happiness just a paw away! 
        The main message this business hopes to portray is the love 
        of animals who can help those who need it, and vice versa. 
        This business stands on loyalty, trust, and growth. Our business 
        is more focused on the wellbeing of others and these precious animals. 
        With everything seeming like a money scheme nowadays, it is hard for 
        many to trust us when trying to find their future best friend. We offer 
        the trust and loyalty you wonâ€™t find in most places. We ensure the safety 
        of our customers just as much as we do our pets. We ensure they are up to 
        date on their shots and are well trained for family interaction. We also 
        offer free 6 mmonth veterinary services to ensure customers get the most 
        from their commitment. </p>

      <h3>Established in 2022</h3>
      <p>Created from a small bedroom in Queens, NY. I sell forever friends. 
        With animals who are left alone in various circumstances, my job is to 
        care for them and help them reach a stronger point in their lives and 
        share the love with an owner they can trust. As of now, I only sell various 
        dog and cat breeds however there is possibility in the future for more pet 
        opportunities.</p>
